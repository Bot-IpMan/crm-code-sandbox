### üß± Upcoming Modular Enhancements

To keep ProCRM future-proof for advanced competitive-intelligence workflows, the next major release focuses on a "LEGO-style" architecture and enterprise-grade productivity upgrades:

- **Modular Canvas** ‚Äì every dashboard block will behave like an independent module that can be created from templates, rearranged with drag-and-drop between competitor workspaces, duplicated, deleted, resized, and repositioned with pixel precision.
- **High-volume Performance Optimizations** ‚Äì engineered for scenarios with 20 competitors √ó 100 modules each through virtualized scrolling (render only what is visible), lazy loading of heavy widgets, multi-level client/cache layers, and cursor-based pagination for data-heavy tables.
- **Intelligent Navigation** ‚Äì introduces a sidebar tree with counters, multi-tab workspace, lightning-fast global search panel (Ctrl+K), and split-view layouts for side-by-side comparisons.
- **Bulk Operations Toolkit** ‚Äì bulk-edit fields across competitor groups, apply template presets to multiple entities at once, mass-move modules between views, and streamline data import/export.

**Practical gains:** sub‚Äë2‚Äësecond loading for any screen, flexible drag-and-drop customization, smooth scaling to thousands of records, and full keyboard-driven control for power users.
